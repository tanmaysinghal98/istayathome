<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://istayathome.in)

### Motivation

Enthusiasm is more contagious than a virus
- We need a reason for celebration, specially when we cannot go out
- Productively utilise time
- Realistic challenges
- Sharing enthusiasm
- Virtually connecting with our buddies for a purpose
  - Adding a purpose like sharing an innovative challenge
- Sharing positivity on social media
  - For example, Ice bucket challenge shared on Instagram
  
### Idea

- üì±A webapp platform to showcase a list of challenges
  - Example of challenges: See your childhood photos, Try old clothes, Create a meme, etc
- üîùUsers will complete challenges and gain points
  - Completing a challenge will earn user points
- üíØCelebratory image as a recognition once challenge is completed
- üíïSharing options to share on Social Media and nominate friends
  - Share and earn more traction, in turn spread good vibes

### Implementation

- Front end hosted on S3 bucket
- Get challenges from DynamoDB through API gateway
- A unique user is created if existing user cookie is not found
- When image is uploaded, lambda creates another achievement image and stores in S3
- Same image is returned to UI, as a shareable content
- User can update personal information on Profile page; User information stored in DynamoDB


### Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
